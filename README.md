# Tetris
Tetris is a classic game that we all used to play on our brickgames. You play this game 
on a simulated terminal, with a textual interface.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Pygame Python 2.1.2 installed and running on your machine. You can install Pygame Python with the latest version by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
pip install pygame
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 Tetris 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
